Object Orientated Programming with JS

The New Keyword:
  Creates an empty object
  Sets the keyword this to be that empty object
  It adds the line 'return this' to the end of the function
  Adds a property onto the empty object called "__proto__", which links the prototype property on the constructor function to the empty object
